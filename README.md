# vizhub-ui

UI for the next generation of VizHub.

## Project Mission

To provide an inclusive world class editing and publishing environment for interactive visual software on the Web.

## Long Term Goals

This project may well be the beachhead for a bona fide [open core](https://medium.com/open-consensus/2-open-core-definition-examples-tradeoffs-e4d0c044da7c) reincarnation of [VizHub.com](https://vizhub.com/). VizHub has been closed source since version 2. Let's call this next reincarnation VizHub 3. Long term goals include:

 * **Self-hosting** - It should be possible to self-host your own instance of VizHub 3, using 100% open source code.
 * **Mobile UX** - It should be possible to develop interactive visual software on a smartphone.
 * **Internationalization** - The interface should be in your local language, for the global VizHub audience.
 * **Accessibility** - The UI should be accessible, fully navigable by keyboard and screen reader.
 * **Extensibility** - It should be possible to extend the open core with proprietary plugins that add features.

## Development

This project is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).

To get your development environment up and running:

```
npm install
npm run build-css
npm run build-js
http-server
```

## Current Status

This project is nascent, but it appears possible to re-build the entire VizHub UI and indeed the full stack open core of the next generation VizHub product using this approach. Screenshots of progress so far:
